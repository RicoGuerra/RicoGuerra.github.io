            <br>
            It has been 50 years since astronauts last walked on the lunar surface during the Apollo programme. The aim
            of NASA’s lunar exploration programme, Artemis, to which the European Space Agency (ESA) and several
            national space agencies are contributing, is to establish a sustainable human presence by 2028. The goal is
            to “go forward to the Moon” and use what is learned on and around the Moon to take the next giant leap,
            sending astronauts to Mars. ESA and commercial partners are currently preparing the development of a
            European Large Logistics Lander (EL3). The EL3 is being designed to allow various missions with different
            options for its payloads, such as scientific payloads, crew supplies, or unpressurised rovers to support
            human expeditions. A cargo deployment solution that fulfils EL3's mission requirements and allows easy
            interaction by astronauts has yet to be designed, however it is essential to the success of future missions
            involving human interaction. <a

            <b>Abstract: </b>
            <br>
            Nowadays, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are acquiring increasing importance. In light of
            the fact that this is true not only for gaming or entertainment, but also for business and scientific
            scenarios, such immersive technologies may become as immensely important to us as Web 2.0 did over a decade
            ago. For such paradigms with rising significance over time, well de-fined guidelines, models, or even
            standards can be advantageous for enhancing usability. In the 1980s, the Keystroke-Level Model introduced a
            method with this objective in mind. Also providing developers with the means to efficiently evaluate and
            enhance the usability of their application in terms of time and effort. In this paper, we present a fist
            step toward such a model for immersive ap-plications by extending the Keystroke-Level Model. We determine
            new operators, specific to AR and VR, and after that, providing unit times for each of the new operators by
            measuring the times it takes to carry out a specific operation as part of a user study.

            <b>Abstract: </b>
            <br>
            The European Large Logistics Lander (EL3) is being designed to carry out cargo delivery missions in support
            of
            future lunar ground crews. The capacity of virtual reality (VR) to visualize and interactively simulate the
            unique lunar environment makes it a potentially powerful design tool during the early development stages of
            EL3,
            as well as other relevant technologies. Based on input from the EL3 development team, we have produced a
            VR-based operational scenario featuring a hypothetical configuration of the lander. Relying on HCI research
            methods, we have subsequently evaluated this scenario with relevant experts (n=10). Qualitative findings
            from
            this initial pilot study have demonstrated the usefulness of VR as a design tool in this context, but
            likewise
            surfaced a number of limitations in the form of potentially impaired validity and generalizability. We
            conclude
            by outlining our future research plan and reflect on the potential use of physical stimuli to improve the
            validity of VR-based simulations in forthcoming design activities.
